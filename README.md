There were a lot of interesting statistics about software engineering in this article. One statistic I found interesting was that Python is both one of the most commonly used languages among software engineers as well as the language that most software engineers want to learn in the next year. I also found it interesting that employers found it more important for a potential hire to have a willingness to learn than to have technical skill or prior work experiance. Also, only 5% of potential employers responded that a college degree was their most important hiring criteria. I was not surprised to see the importance of a team environment in attracting and retaining software developers, as software engineering is almost always going to require a good team to be successful.
